## What is NeoCoin?
**NeoCoin** is based on **CFC ( Company Financial Capital )**. As mentioned, the value of a **NeoCoin** is calculated based on the **financial capital of the company**. The higher the **financial capital**, the higher the value of the **NeoCoin**.

Each **NeoCoin** is actually based on ten percent of the **company's financial capital**. Simply put, if **company's financial capital** today is $ 100,000, each **NeoCoin** is worth $ 10,000.

If the **financial capital of the company** today is the same as $ 100,000, as mentioned, then each **NeoCoin** is worth $ 10,000. So if you buy 10 **NeoCoin** equal to $ 100,000, the **company's financial capital** will increase by $ 100,000, which will increase the price of the **NeoCoin** again.

So by increasing $ 100,000 on the **company's $ 100,000 capital**, the company will have **$ 200,000 capital**, which will increase the value of the $ 10,000 **NeoCoin** to $ 20,000.
