*Neo-Coin system core.*

## How does it works?
**NeoCoin** is based on **CFC ( Company Financial Capital )**. As mentioned, the value of a **NeoCoin** is calculated based on the **financial capital of the company**. The higher the **financial capital**, the higher the value of the **NeoCoin**.

Each **NeoCoin** is actually based on ten percent of the **company's financial capital**. Simply put, if **company's financial capital** today is $ 100,000, each **NeoCoin** is worth $ 10,000.

If the **financial capital of the company** today is the same as $ 100,000, as mentioned, then each **NeoCoin** is worth $ 10,000. So if you buy 10 **NeoCoin** equal to $ 100,000, the **company's financial capital** will increase by $ 100,000, which will increase the price of the **NeoCoin** again.

So by increasing $ 100,000 on the **company's $ 100,000 capital**, the company will have **$ 200,000 capital**, which will increase the value of the $ 10,000 **NeoCoin** to $ 20,000.

## Why NeoCoin?
One of the most important reasons is that you increase the value of each coin by buying it, and you will see the value of the coin increase in the near future.
